# Disabling Supabase Built-in Confirmation Emails

To ensure only SendGrid emails are sent (not Supabase's default emails), follow these steps:

## Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase (Recommended for Custom Flow)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Providers**
3. Click on **Email** provider
4. Scroll down to **Confirm email**
5. **Toggle OFF** "Enable email confirmations"

This will disable Supabase's automatic confirmation emails entirely, and you'll handle everything via SendGrid.

## Option 2: Use Custom SMTP (Advanced)

If you want to keep Supabase confirmation but customize it:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Email Templates**
2. Click on **Confirm signup** template
3. Customize the template HTML
4. Or set up Custom SMTP to route through SendGrid

## Current Implementation

The app now:
- ✅ Sends **only SendGrid** custom confirmation emails
- ✅ Disables Supabase built-in emails in signup flow
- ✅ Uses custom confirmation URL
- ✅ Handles email confirmation via `/confirm-email` route

## Testing

After disabling Supabase emails:
1. Sign up at `http://localhost:5173/signup`
2. Check your inbox - you should receive **only** the SendGrid custom email
3. Click the confirmation link
4. You'll be redirected and see the confirmation page

## Important Notes

- Make sure to disable email confirmation in Supabase settings
- SendGrid must be properly configured
- For production, consider using Supabase Edge Functions for better security
- Current implementation sends confirmation URL via client-side (suitable for MVP)
